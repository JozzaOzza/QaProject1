QaProject1 would more aptly be called "Inventory Management System."

# Description

The application allows users to Create, Read, Update and Delete this information, as well as removing individual tems from orders, and viewing the total order cost as part of Read.
The application runs on Java.

# Installation

There are several applications to install before attempting to use this application:
  - Eclipse IDE. https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer . 
  - Apache Maven. https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi . How to: How to: https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS323/Installing+Apache+Maven+on+Windows
  - MySQL Workbench (editing the schema). https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

To set up the application:

  1. Fork the repository on GitHub. https://github.com/JozzaOzza/QaProject1
  2. GitBash command to clone repository. ' git clone <link to forked repo> '

# Usage

When the application and all its dependencies have been installed, run the program.
The Console should read: "Welcome to the Inventory Management System!
                          Which entity would you like to use?
                          CUSTOMER: Information about customers
                          ITEM: Individual Items
                          ORDER: Purchases of items
                          STOP: To close the application"
                          
The words in CAPITAL LETTERS can be typed into the console as commands.
Typing in "customer" and pressing 'Enter' would bring you to the CUSTOMER section of the application. 
Again, any words printed to the console in CAPITAL LETTERS can be used as commands.

Accessing these commands inside CUSTOMER, ITEMS, or ORDERS will either prompt you to enter in words or numbers as input, or will take you back to the main menu.
